# Configuration files
- `.zshrc`
- `config/i3/config`
- `.Xresources`

### TODO
- `sudo rmmod iwlifi && sudo modprobe iwlwifi`
- Start keepassxc, virtualbox, blueman-manager
- Rice i3
	- Dim inactive windows (or other noticable difference; see note on borders)
	- Fix i3 not working with titles (remove completely? or get to work and add back?)
	- Remove icons from i3blocks (assuming they can be prevented from being created in the first place)
	- Add increment/decrement workspace to i3 ($mod+alt+hjkl/arrows?)
	- Rice i3lock
	- Run i3lock when user is idle for 5 minutes (and suspend if on battery power)
	- Run i3lock when suspending/hibernating
	- Have i3, gtk, qt, slack, and .Xresources colors decided based upon wallpaper?
	- Use rofi instead of dmenu for open window, file manager, and ssh support
- Make gtk colors go to qt
	- Fix gtk (3?) theme not working with intellij
- Rice Xorg/urxvt
- Sign in to Spotify
- Install/enable hardware 2D and 3D acceleration
- Tweak libinput/xinput touchpad and mouse (viz., australian scrolling, tap to click; middle click scroll)
- Use urxvtd
- Enable colors in zsh
	- Have $PS1 include color background
- Fix i3blocks statusbar (volume, mem, and swap are wrong; network? causes resize; make font smaller)
